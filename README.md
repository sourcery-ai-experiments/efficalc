# Introduction

##### efficalc provides an extensible, testable, and powerful framework for building and managing complex calculations.

**efficalc** is designed to transform how engineers approach calculations, moving away from traditional methods like manual spreadsheets and toward a more efficient, accurate, and collaborative engineering calculation process.

### Simple syntax for Python calculations:

# Quickstart

### Installation

Install efficalc with pip:

```bash
pip install efficalc
```

### First Calculation Function

Calculations in efficalc are written as a function. 

These calculation functions are primarily composed of `Input` and `Calculation` elements, but there are also many more options to make a clear and accurate calculation.

```python
from efficalc import Calculation, Input, Title, sqrt

def calculation():
    Title("Pythagorean's Theorem and Perimeter")
    
    a = Input("a", 3, description="Length of side a")
    b = Input("b", 4, description="Length of side b")
    
    c = Calculation("c", sqrt(a**2 + b**2), description="Length of the hypotenuse")
    
    Calculation("P", a + b + c, description="Perimeter of the triangle")
```

### View the Report

Instantly view or print a report for your calculation in your browser with the `ReportBuilder`.

```python
from efficalc.report_builder import ReportBuilder
from pythagorean_perimeter import calculation

builder = ReportBuilder(calculation)
builder.view_report()
```

![The resulting calculation report](https://github.com/youandvern/efficalc/raw/main/docs_src/_static/pythagorean_default.png)


### Updating Input Values

The value provided to the `Input` class in your calculation function is treated as a default value. 

When you run your calculation with different input values, pass in a dictionary of the default overrides into the optional second parameter of the `ReportBuilder`:


```python
new_inputs = {"a": 9.2, "b": 0.87}
builder = ReportBuilder(calculation, new_inputs)
builder.view_report()
```
